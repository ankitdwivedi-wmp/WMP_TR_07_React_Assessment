# React Todo, StateCitySelector, PostSelecter

## Project Overview
This React application demonstrates effective component usage, state management, and API integration through a centralized interceptor file. The application consists of three main components: a To-Do List, a State and City Selector, and a Post Selector. Each component showcases dynamic data rendering and user interaction, while the interceptor file manages all API calls using Axios.

## Features
- **To-Do List**: Users can add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks. Tasks can be filtered by status (All, Completed, Pending).
- **State and City Selector**: Users can select a state from a dropdown, which dynamically updates the city dropdown based on the selected state. The selected values are displayed on the screen.
- **Post Selector**: Fetches posts from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays them in a dropdown. Upon selection, the post's title and body are shown in a styled card.

## Technologies Used
- React(Vite)
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS
